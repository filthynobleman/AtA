# AtA
This repository contains the code related to the article ...  
  
Each folder contains a separate project, with its own building instruction and sample applications. Please, refer to the proper `README` file for each sub-project.  

Here's a list of the projects and their content:
 - `sequential` contains the implementation of the sequential AtA algorithm, and provides an efficient implementation of the Strassen's algorithm.
 - `shared` contains the implementation of the parallel AtA algorithm in a shared memory model. The same Strassen's algorithm from `sequential` is also contained here.
 - `distributed` contains the implementation of the parallel AtA algorithm in a distributed memory model.
